Project Overview

Title: Password Checker

Description: The Basic NIST Password Checker is a web application designed to check if a given password meets the new NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) password requirements. Its purpose is to ensure that passwords are secure and strong enough to resist common attacks. The target audience for this Password Checker includes anyone who wants to create or evaluate the strength of passwords, such as website administrators, developers, and individuals concerned about their online security.

Roles and Responsibilities

My role in this project was the developer. The project scope and resources was given by my professor and using that information I was able to develop all the code for this project. My specific responsibilities for this project was ensuring there were no code errors and making sure the JavaScript code worked as intended.

Tools and Technologies

The three main languages used for this project were HTML, for the interface that the user interacts with, CSS, the stylization of the HTML webpage, and JavaScript, the code that allows the password checker to check the inputted password based on the requirements of NIST. The software used for this project was entirely VS Code and no frameworks or libraries were used for this project.

Project Details

Project Duration: This project was given on 1 week to complete. It was started on 11/23/2020 and completed on 11/30/2020.

Team Size: 1 person (Me!) was involved in this project.

My contribution: In this project, I referenced w3schools HTML, CSS, and JavaScript reference to get a good starting point on creating the code. After I knew what methods I would need, I created the HTML and CSS code first as that was mainly interface oriented. Once I had a good interface ready, I coded the JavaScript code. I first created psuedocode for the JavaScript that descibed what the password checker is supposed to do and how it checks passwords. Then I coded an array of bad or insuffecient passwords and created a loop that checks whether the password meets the requirements listed above or includes one of the bad passwords in the array.

Key Features

Some key features of this project include:
- Character Limit of at least 8 characters or more
- It cannot be a list of commonly known bad passwords
- Useful for quick password checks

Outcome and Lessons Learned

This project provided a good example into password management and the requirements of what makes a good password for security. This project also helped me specifically learn how to utilize arrays in JavaScript to create a series of checks using loops and if statements.
